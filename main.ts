// A literal is a more concrete sub-type of a collective type. What this means is that "Hello World" is a string, but a string is not "Hello World" inside the type system.


// There are three sets of literal types available in TypeScript today: strings, numbers, and booleans; by using literal types you can allow an exact value which a string, number, or boolean must have.

// Literal Narrowing
// When you declare a variable via var or let, you are telling the compiler that there is the chance that this variable will change its contents. In contrast, using const to declare a variable will inform TypeScript that this object will never change.

// We're making a guarantee that this variable
// helloWorld will never change, by using const.
 
// So, TypeScript sets the type to be "Hello World", not string
const helloWorld = "Hello World";
 
// On the other hand, a let can change, and so the compiler declares it a string
let hiWorld = "Hi World";
// Try
// The process of going from an infinite number of potential cases (there is an infinite number of possible string values) to a smaller, finite number of potential case (in helloWorldâ€™s case: 1) is called narrowing.

// String Literal Types
// In practice string literal types combine nicely with union types, type guards, and type aliases. You can use these features together to get enum-like behavior with strings.

// Argument of type '"uneasy"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Easing'.
// Try
// You can pass any of the three allowed strings, but any other string will give the error

// Argument of type '"uneasy"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"ease-in" | "ease-out" | "ease-in-out"'
// String literal types can be used in the same way to distinguish overloads:


// Numeric Literal Types
// TypeScript also has numeric literal types, which act the same as the string literals above.
